# Etch-A-Sketch

## Description

This assigned project is my attempt at creating an Etch-A-Sketch. It works like an Etch-A-Sketch where the user
can draw on the sketch pad, erase their drawing, change the size of the sketch pad and reset the size of the sketch pad
to its original size. 

I have used HTML and CSS (HTML5 and CSS3) for this project. To make it dynamic and functional, I have also used JavaScript.

This is a difficult project where my knowledge on HTML, CSS and JavaScript and how to use them together to build the front end of a web page are being tested.

## How to draw on the sketch pad

1. Move the cursor of your mouse over the screen with the white background (the sketch pad itself).

2. Erase your drawing by clicking on the **Erase** button.

3. Change the size of the sketch pad by clicking on the **New sketch pad size** button.

**NOTE: This Etch-A-Sketch only accepts whole number/integer values from 2 - 100 to change the size of the sketch pad**

4. Click the **Reset** button to set the size of the sketch pad  to its original size as when the web page had first loaded on the web browser.
